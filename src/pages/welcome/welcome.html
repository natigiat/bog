    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Welcome to TAU's 2017 All-Access Mission!</span>
    <br>
   
 
We are delighted that you are joining our All Access Mission May 16 - 20, 2017. We have especially crafted this event to give you a rare, insider’s perspective on Israel's famous innovation in action.
 

 <br>
 <br><br>

Only a select few have been invited to join. Your co-participants are other like-minded, influential leaders from around the world who are committed to Israel and who are looking for new ways to strengthen its global contribution and image. 
 <br><br>

Located in Tel Aviv, core of the “start-up nation,” TAU plays an integral role in Israel’s economic prosperity and national security. Joint projects with the country’s most successful R&D centers and companies, combined with rich expertise in fields of global importance, have made TAU a recognized powerhouse of entrepreneurship and innovation.    
 <br><br>

 
This is reinforced by a campus culture of imaginative thinking; we encourage our researchers and students to dare and strive as Israel’s future leaders, innovators and educators. We have a strong track record: among our more than 150,000 alumni are the current and former Israel Defense Forces Chief-of-Staff, the CEOs of Israel’s major banks, the man who was instrumental in developing the Iron Dome, the brains behind Waze and Viber, and Oscar-winning film directors.  TAU ranks in Reuters Top 100 Most Innovative Universities, and has been ranked 9th in the world for the highest number of alumni going on to become successful entrepreneurs.
  <br><br>
 
 All this, and more, will offer boundless opportunities for collaboration and networking.  
  <br><br>

  We look forward to meeting you soon.
  <br><br>


Sincerely,<br><br><br>

 </p>
