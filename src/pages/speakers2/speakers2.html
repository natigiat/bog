         <input type="hidden" value="Dr. Yossi Yovel started his academic career at Tel Aviv University where he completed two BSc degrees in the years 2001-2004, one in Biology and one in Physics. Since then he has been looking for ways to apply computational methods to the biological questions he is interested in. During his MSc studies at Tel Aviv University he developed an algorithm that uses a multi-dimensional MRI data set to improve brain tissue segmentation. He then moved to Germany where he completed his PhD thesis as part of collaboration between the University of Tuebingen and the Max Planck institute for biological cybernetics. His goal was to apply computer algorithms from the machine learning field to study how the brain classifies objects. He worked with bats that use echoes to classify plants and was both training them to classify objects and using robotics to mimic their sonar system. In October 2011 he began setting up the neuro-ecology lab for active sensing and sensory perception at Tel Aviv University which uses bats as a main animal model. To monitor these bats he developed the smallest GPS device in the world that can be mounted on a bat to track its position and includes an ultrasonic microphone to record its sonar and communication activity. This very unique setup will allow the team to take neuroscience into the field. To study behavior in the lab, Yovel is building the most sophisticated recording room in the world that will include more than 100 ultrasonic microphones and 20 high-speed IR cameras. Finally, to study neural correlates the research team is developing the ability to use fMRI with conscious bats and do EEG recordings in real time. Yovel believe that these new, state-of-the-art technologies will enable a leap in the understanding of behavior and how it is encoded in the brain.">
